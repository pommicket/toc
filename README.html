<h3>About</h3>

<p><code>toc</code> is currently in development. <strong>It is not a stable language,
and there are almost definitely bugs right now.</strong>
I would recommend against using it for anything big or important.
Many parts of it may change in the future.</p>

<p><code>toc</code> improves on C's syntax (and semantics) in many ways,
To declare <code>x</code> as an integer and set it to 5,
you can do:</p>

<p><code>
x := 5; // Declare x and set x to 5 (infer type) <br />
x : int = 5; // Explicitly make the type int. <br />
x : int; x = 5; // Declare x as an integer, then set it to 5.
</code></p>

<p><code>toc</code> is statically typed and has many of C's features, but
it is just as fast in theory.</p>

<p>See <code>docs</code> for more information.</p>
